# salesreportdashv1.0
A dashboard I have created on an example set of sales data. This was made during my beginner level of learning Python for the use of data analytics and visualization. The purpose of this sales dashboard is to inform stakeholders of the KPIs of each salesman, and other insightful information. This project was created with Python and the use of the libraries of Pandas, Plotly Express, and StreamLit.
